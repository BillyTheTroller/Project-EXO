### 📍 **Milestone 2: Hardware Reverse Engineering (Weeks 5-8)**  
✅ **Dump & Analyze Firmware**  
- [ ] Identify **NAND/eMMC storage points**.  
- [ ] Attempt **firmware dumping (if feasible under legal constraints)**.  
- [ ] Analyze **boot sequence & encryption mechanisms**.  

✅ **PCB Analysis & Hardware Testing**  
- [ ] Map **traces of key hardware components**.  
- [ ] Probe **debug ports (if any exist)**.  
- [ ] Test **voltage glitching or clock manipulation methods**.  

📂 **Deliverables:**  
- 📄 [`docs/hardware_pinning.md`](docs/hardware_pinning.md) → Xbox One S pinout diagrams.  
- 📄 [`logs/debug_attempts.txt`](logs/debug_attempts.txt) → Documentation of all debug/hardware access attempts.

### 📍 **Milestone 3: Hardmod Development (Weeks 9-14)**  
✅ **Develop a Proof-of-Concept Hardmod**  
- [ ] Test **various attack strategies** (e.g., modchip injection, glitching).  
- [ ] Identify **potential points of control** (CPU, memory bus, or firmware loading).  
- [ ] Validate **modchip feasibility (if needed)**.  

✅ **Modify Boot Process**  
- [ ] Attempt **modification of boot chain**.  
- [ ] Bypass **security restrictions (without violating DMCA guidelines)**.  
- [ ] Establish **persistent boot control (if possible)**.  

📂 **Deliverables:**  
- 📄 [`hardware/modchip_prototype.md`](hardware/modchip_prototype.md) → Design & testing logs for potential modchips.  
- 📄 [`hardware/boot_analysis.md`](hardware/boot_analysis.md) → Findings on Xbox One S boot behavior.

### 📍 **Milestone 4: Xbox Dashboard Restoration (Weeks 15-20)**  
✅ **Develop Retro Dashboard Software**  
- [ ] Reverse engineer **original Xbox dashboard (2001)**.  
- [ ] Adapt code for **Xbox One S compatibility**.  
- [ ] Ensure **hardware communication between the modchip (if used) and software**.  

✅ **Test & Debug Dashboard Functionality**  
- [ ] Verify **UI stability, performance, and responsiveness**.  
- [ ] Ensure compatibility with **Xbox One S hardware & input devices**.  
- [ ] Prevent **bricking & identify rollback solutions**.  

📂 **Deliverables:**  
- 📄 [`software/dashboard_retro.md`](software/dashboard_retro.md) → Documentation of dashboard recreation.  
- 📄 [`software/test_results.md`](software/test_results.md) → Bug reports & stability testing logs.  

---

### 📍 **Milestone 5: Academic Paper & Video Showcase (Weeks 21-24)**  
✅ **Prepare Research Paper for Publication**  
- [ ] Structure the paper with **findings, methodologies, and security insights**.  
- [ ] Cite all references & ensure **compliance with legal frameworks**.  
- [ ] Get **peer review (if possible, within academic circles)**.  

✅ **Create Informational Video Showcase**  
- [ ] **Demonstrate research findings** in a clear, legal, and academic manner.  
- [ ] Avoid showing **piracy, DRM circumvention, or proprietary code modifications**.  
- [ ] Upload to **a secure academic/research platform** (avoid mainstream sites if risky).  

📂 **Deliverables:**  
- 📄 [`research_paper/project_edmonton.pdf`](research_paper/project_edmonton.pdf) → Full academic research paper.  
- 📄 [`media/video_demo_links.md`](media/video_demo_links.md) → Links to video showcases.
